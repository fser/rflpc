/** Formated output function.
 * This function is similar to stdio's printf.
    However, it only handles:
    - %%d
    - %%x/X (%0?X can also be used, where ? is a digit [1-9])
    - %%p
    - %%c
    - %%s

    @note If another format char is used, int is assumed to skip
    argument, but nothing is printed unless LPC_VERBOSE_PRINTF
    is defined when compiling lib.

    @warning It uses the putchar function to output all characters. You have to define
    this function in your code so that the link works
