/* This memcpy uses 2 optimisations:

   1- If address are aligned on a 4 byte boundary, it perform as much 4 bytes copy as it can. Then, it copies byte per byte
   2- Each copy phase (word and byte), is unrolled using Duff's device

   It may be further optimized by either
   1- copy byte per byte until a 4 byte boundary aligned is found (if both buffers are similarly aligned)
   2- try to compose words from multiple word aligned reads on the source to write word aligned on destination
