What is it?
-----------
This library allows development on a LPC17xx board from NXP.
The release includes configuration for the MBED platform which uses a LPC1768.

It includes:
- Linker script and board initialization code
- Drivers for several peripherals

What is needed?
---------------
In order to compile, you will need a gcc version tuned to build bare metal binaries.
I use the one which can be build by using the shell script available here: 

https://github.com/esden/summon-arm-toolchain


This release includes the LPC17xx.h from NXP and core_m3.h from ARM header
files. This files include the definition of structures for mapping the CPU and
the peripheral registers.
