/* Initialise clock to use main oscillator for PLL0.

   CPU is set to 96Mhz using the 12Mhz source for PLL0. (see mbed schematic,
   main oscillator is a 12Mhz crystal connected to pins XTAL1 and XTAL2)

   As this setup is suitable for USB, so PPL0 can be used to clock USB (need a 48Mhz mutiple)

   The output of the PLL0 is given by:
   Fcco = (2xMxFin)/N where Fin is the frequency of the source (12Mhz), M the
   multiplier and N the pre-divider (p.41)
   Fcco = 2x12x12/1 = 288Mhz
   We thus have M=12 and N=1, so we have to write 0xB in the PLL0CFG register (p. 37)
   To get the 100Mhz CPU clock, we must set the cpu clock divider to 3 (288/3 = 96).
   This is done by setting CCLKSEL register to 2 (p. 55)
