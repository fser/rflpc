If you want to contribute to the library, please follow these guidelines to ease the integration\hypertarget{guidelines_contribute}{}\section{How to contribute}\label{guidelines_contribute}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use your github account to fork the {\ttfamily hauspie/rflpc} repository and push your contribution to your fork. Then, send me a pull-\/request for integration to the {\ttfamily develop} branch
\item Always do your development based on the {\ttfamily develop} branch, except if you want to submit me a hotfix of a released version. In the later case, based your work on the master branch, I will take care of integrating the hotfix in the {\ttfamily develop} branch.
\item Try to do some extensive tests on your code, and, if you can, a bit of code review (which I'll do with you anyway before integrating your patch)
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{guidelines_conventions}{}\section{Coding conventions}\label{guidelines_conventions}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All symbol names are in lower case, prefixed by {\ttfamily rflpc\-\_\-} and a term describing the category of the symbol/function. For example\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily rflpc\-\_\-eth\-\_\-xxx} for an ethernet driver
\item {\ttfamily rflpc\-\_\-spi\-\_\-xxx} for S\-P\-I drivers
\item ...
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Type names uses the same prefix guidelines and must finish by a {\ttfamily \-\_\-t} 
\item If possible, prefer static inline functions to macros
\item All new feature must be able to be enabled/disabled using the config system.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item you should put your code in a {\ttfamily \#ifdef R\-F\-L\-P\-C\-\_\-\-C\-O\-N\-F\-I\-G\-\_\-\-E\-N\-A\-B\-L\-E\-\_\-xxx ... \#endif} block. The chosen name must be explicit
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Notable exception to the prefix rule is for function that implements some libc well known functions (\hyperlink{group__libc_ga98631211a4a8aee62f572375d5b637be}{printf}, \hyperlink{group__libc_ga14938524dcbeb59d7117ba5e151ad1b1}{memcpy}, \hyperlink{group__libc_ga362b656d9de3289b55b1035d14cb4b5d}{memset}...)
