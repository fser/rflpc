.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This driver allows the use of the system tick timer\&. 

This timer is intended to generate a precise 10ms timer, however it can be used to count different times\&. But, the tick count is only on 24bits so, at 96Mhz, the maximum wait time is 2^24 ticks (around 170ms)
.PP
Its counter is decremented at each clock tick, and when the counter reaches 0, an interrupt can be generated\&. The time between interrupts thus depends on the counter value and the clock speed\&.
.PP
This driver uses the cpu clock as the reference clock for the timer\&.
